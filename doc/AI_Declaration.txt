3. DESCRIPTION OF AI USE
------------------------------------------------------------
Briefly describe what you used AI for and how:
I first used it to guide me through downloading Android Studio properly as my PC was having some issues. Then, since I am new to this topic, I used AI to understand what happens where and how things work. I used it to find out what folders I might need for what I want to do in the project. I also used it to generate a code snippet of the base interface of the keyboard and panels to see what everything should look like and how the codes should be arranged. Then I used AI to go through every detail and understand everything, and why something worked the way it did. Then I also used it to properly understand how the connections worked and how to connect things to do what I want to do. I then proceeded to use it to learn more about android studio in general.
